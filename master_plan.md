# **LinguaScribe: Static Codebase Implementation Master Plan (v3 - Consolidated)**

This document outlines the high-level plan for building the static UI for LinguaScribe. It is designed to be executed in large, autonomous phases.

## **The Plan**

### `[x]` Phase A: Project Setup & UI Scaffolding
**Goal:** Execute all initial project setup, dependency installation, core layout adaptation, and scaffold all new LinguaScribe pages. The output will be a fully prepared codebase ready for feature component implementation.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-a-setup-and-scaffolding.md)

---
### `[x]` Phase B: Component Implementation (By Epic)
**Goal:** Systematically build all new, static, reusable components required by the LinguaScribe epics, integrating them into the scaffolded pages from Phase A.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-b-component-implementation.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase C: Theming & Visual Polish
**Goal:** Implement light/dark mode and conduct a full visual review to refine styling and ensure a cohesive look and feel across all new components.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-c-theming-and-polish.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase D: Finalization & Handoff
**Goal:** Perform final code cleanup, add developer documentation, and prepare the static codebase for handoff to the backend integration phase.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-d-finalization-and-handoff.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase E: Database & Schema Implementation
**Goal:** Establish the application's data layer by creating the database schema, running the initial migration, and seeding it with necessary initial data.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-e-database-and-schema.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase F: API Route & Backend Logic Implementation
**Goal:** Build all the backend API routes as defined in the application epics. This involves creating the logic for CRUD operations, AI interactions, and business rules.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-f-api-implementation.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase G: Frontend Integration with React Query
**Goal:** Replace all mock data in the frontend components with live data from the newly created API. This involves using `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching, caching, and mutations.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-g-frontend-integration.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase H: External Service Integration (Stripe)
**Goal:** Implement the complete billing and subscription lifecycle by integrating with the Stripe API, including checkout sessions, the customer portal, and webhook handling.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-h-stripe-integration.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase I: Final Testing & Deployment Preparation
**Goal:** Conduct end-to-end testing of the fully integrated application, configure production environment variables, and prepare the project for its first deployment.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-i-testing-and-deployment.md)
