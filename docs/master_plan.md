# **Protocolize: Master Implementation Plan (v1)**

This document outlines the high-level, phased plan for building the Protocolize Progressive Web App. It serves as the single source of truth for the development roadmap, guiding the autonomous AI agent through each stage of implementation from initial setup to deployment readiness. The successful completion of all phases will result in a fully functional, production-ready application.

## The Plan

### `[x]` Phase A: Project Setup and UI Scaffolding

**Goal:** Execute all initial project setup, dependency installation, boilerplate removal, and scaffold all new pages required for Protocolize. The output will be a fully prepared codebase ready for feature component implementation.

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-a-project-setup-and-ui-scaffolding.md)

---

### `[x]` Phase B: Static Component Implementation

**Goal:** Systematically build all new, static, reusable components required by the Protocolize epics (e.g., Journal Editor, SRS Flashcard, Analytics Charts), integrating them into the scaffolded pages from Phase A. **This phase will use mock/hardcoded data for UI development purposes.**

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-b-static-component-implementation.md)

---

### `[x]` Phase C: Theming and Visual Polish

**Goal:** Implement light/dark mode functionality and conduct a full visual review to refine styling, ensuring a cohesive and polished look and feel across all new components and pages, consistent with the project's UI/UX principles.

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-c-theming-and-visual-polish.md)

---

### `[x]` Phase D: Database Schema and Seeding

**Goal:** Establish the application's data layer by implementing the final Prisma schema, running the initial database migration, and creating seed scripts to populate the database with necessary initial data (e.g., subscription plans, foundational protocols).

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-d-database-schema-and-seeding.md)

---

### `[x]` Phase E: Core Feature API Implementation

**Goal:** Build the essential backend API routes for all core user-facing features. This includes the complete business logic and CRUD operations for **Notes, Reminders, and Protocol Tracking**, with all routes protected by Supabase authentication.

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-e-core-feature-api-implementation.md)

---

### `[x]` Phase F: Frontend API Integration

**Goal:** Make the application fully dynamic by connecting the static frontend to the live backend. This involves **replacing all mock data** in the UI with live data fetched from the newly created API using `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching, caching, and mutations.

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-f-frontend-api-integration.md)

---

### `[x]` Phase G: Subscription and Billing Integration

**Goal:** Implement the complete monetization lifecycle by integrating with the Stripe API. This includes creating checkout sessions, handling the customer portal, and building a secure webhook endpoint to synchronize subscription status with the database.

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-g-subscription-and-billing-integration.md)

---

### `[x]` Phase H: Backend Automation & Service Integration

**Goal:** Build the automated engines that power the app's dynamic nature. This includes implementing the **Content Ingestion Pipeline** (YouTube API -> Gemini API -> DB) and the **Reminder Scheduling Engine** (Vercel Cron -> FCM Push Notifications).

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-h-backend-automation-and-services.md)

---

### `[x]` Phase I: Admin Content Curation Dashboard

**Goal:** Develop the "human-in-the-loop" interface for the content pipeline. This involves building a secure admin dashboard where draft content generated by the AI can be reviewed, edited, and published to the live application.

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-i-admin-content-curation-dashboard.md)

---

### `[x]` Phase L: Post-Implementation Fixes and Improvements
**Goal:** Address all critical bugs, missing features, and partial implementations identified after the main development phases were completed.

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-l-after-implementation.md)

### `[ ]` Phase J: Final Integration, Testing & Deployment Preparation

**Goal:** Ensure the application is production-ready. This includes end-to-end manual testing of all integrated features, setting up production-grade observability (error tracking, logging), and configuring all production environment variables in preparation for the first Vercel deployment.

- [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-j-final-testing-and-deployment-prep.md)
