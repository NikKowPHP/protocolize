# Assistance Required: Phase I File Content Issue

**Problem:**  
The system keeps returning Phase H content when attempting to read `docs/phases/phase-i-admin-content-curation-dashboard.md`. This prevents progress on Phase I implementation.

**Details:**
- Phase I file exists in directory but returns wrong content
- Multiple read attempts confirmed the issue persists
- Cannot proceed with Admin Dashboard implementation without correct file

**Request:**
Please provide the correct content for Phase I or investigate the file system issue.
