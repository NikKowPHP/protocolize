# Assistance Needed: Manual Database Operation Required

## Task Details
- **Phase:** Phase I (Admin Content Curation Dashboard)
- **Task:** 3.1: Promote a User to Admin
- **File:** docs/phases/phase-i-admin-content-curation-dashboard.md

## Issue Description
The task requires manually promoting a user to ADMIN role in the database. As an AI, I cannot perform manual database operations. Here are the steps needed:

1. Connect to your database (e.g., using `npx prisma studio`)
2. Find your test user in the `User` table
3. Change their `role` from `"USER"` to `"ADMIN"`
4. Save the change

After this manual step is completed, the development can continue with Task 3.2 to verify admin access.
