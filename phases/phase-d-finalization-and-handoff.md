# Phase D: Finalization & Handoff

**Goal:** Perform final code cleanup, add developer documentation, and prepare the static codebase for handoff to the backend integration phase.

---

### 1. Code Cleanup & Refactoring

-   [ ] **Task 1.1: Refactor Components to Receive Data via Props.**
    *   **Action:** Go through the key components built in Phase B. Remove any internal mock data and refactor them to be pure components that receive all their data via props. The parent *page* component can still hold the mock data to pass down for now.
    *   **Checklist of Components to Refactor:**
        -   `src/components/JournalHistoryList.tsx`: Should accept a `journals` prop (e.g., `journals: { id: string, title: string, snippet: string, date: string }[]`).
        -   `src/components/AnalysisDisplay.tsx`: Should accept `text` and `highlights` props.
        -   `src/components/FeedbackCard.tsx`: Should accept `feedback` as a single prop object.
        -   `src/components/StudySession.tsx`: Should accept a `cards` prop.
        -   `src/components/ProficiencyChart.tsx` & `src/components/SubskillScores.tsx`: Should accept a `data` prop.
        -   `src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx`: Should accept a `users` prop.

-   [ ] **Task 1.2: Remove All Temporary `console.log` Statements.**
    *   **Action:** Perform a project-wide search for `console.log` and remove any instances used for debugging during development.
    *   **Verification Command (for human review or advanced AI):**
        ```bash
        grep -r "console.log" ./src/
        ```

-   [ ] **Task 1.3: Run Linter to Remove Unused Imports and Variables.**
    *   **Action:** Use the linter to automatically clean up any unused code.
    ```bash
    npm run lint -- --fix
    ```

### 2. In-Code Documentation

-   [ ] **Task 2.1: Add JSDoc to All Major Reusable Components.**
    *   **Action:** Add comprehensive JSDoc comment blocks to the components created in Phase B. The documentation should explain the component's purpose and define its props.
    *   **Example JSDoc format:**
        ```tsx
        /**
         * Renders an interactive flashcard for the SRS study session.
         * @param {object} props - The component props.
         * @param {object} props.card - The card data to display.
         * @param {string} props.card.frontContent - The text for the front of the card.
         * @param {string} props.card.backContent - The text for the back of the card.
         * @param {function} props.onReview - Callback function when a review button is clicked.
         */
        export function Flashcard({ card, onReview }) {
          // ... component code
        }
        ```
    *   **Checklist of Components to Document:**
        -   `OnboardingWizard.tsx`
        -   `JournalEditor.tsx`
        -   `AnalysisDisplay.tsx`
        -   `FeedbackCard.tsx`
        -   `Flashcard.tsx`
        -   `StudySession.tsx`
        -   `PricingTable.tsx`
        -   `ThemeToggle.tsx`

### 3. Project-Level Documentation

-   [ ] **Task 3.1: Overwrite the Project `README.md` File.**
    *   **Action:** Replace the entire content of the root `README.md` file with a new version that accurately describes the LinguaScribe project and its current state.
    *   **File:** `README.md`
    *   **New Content:**
        ````markdown
        # LinguaScribe - AI Language Learning Platform

        LinguaScribe is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to revolutionize language learning by shifting the focus from passive consumption to active creation.

        ## Current Status: UI Complete

        This repository contains the **complete static UI** for the LinguaScribe application. All pages, components, and user flows have been built out visually using placeholder data. The application is fully styled, themeable (light/dark mode), and responsive.

        **The codebase is now ready for backend integration.**

        ## Next Steps: Backend Integration

        The next phase of development will involve:
        1.  **Database Setup:** Implementing the Prisma schema and running the initial database migration.
        2.  **API Route Implementation:** Building the backend logic for all API routes (`/api/journal`, `/api/analyze`, etc.).
        3.  **Authentication Integration:** Connecting the frontend auth forms to Supabase Auth.
        4.  **Data Fetching:** Replacing all placeholder data in the UI with live data from the API using a library like React Query.
        5.  **Stripe Integration:** Implementing the payment and subscription logic.

        ## Getting Started with the Static UI

        To run the static version of the application locally:

        1.  **Install dependencies:**
            ```bash
            npm install
            ```

        2.  **Run the development server:**
            ```bash
            npm run dev
            ```

        The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Final Verification

-   [ ] **Task 4.1: Run Final Code Formatting Check.**
    *   **Action:** Ensure all files in the project adhere to the Prettier formatting rules.
    ```bash
    npx prettier --write .
    ```

-   [ ] **Task 4.2: Verify `package-lock.json` Integrity.**
    *   **Action:** Run a final `npm install` to ensure the `package-lock.json` file is consistent and up-to-date with the `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
